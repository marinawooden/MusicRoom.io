          <h2>Hello!</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to <em>MusicRoom</em>!  We're a <em>music-sharing platform</em>
            for <em>college creatives</em> looking to share their music and
            collaborate with other musicians in their area!  We know
            how hard it can be to find other musicians and network.
            We aim to provide a <em>user-friendly interface</em> and platform
            to provoke collaboration &#8212; after all, <em>collaboration
            creates innovation.</em>

          <h2>Why did we make this app?</h2>
          <p>
            Many existing platforms let users share their music such as Spotify, Instagram,
            and SoundCloud, but there are no designated platforms that are <em>solely dedicated
            to musicians and connecting them online</em>. MusicRoom is for musicians, specifically
            musicians in colleges and universities nationwide. It provides a place for college
            students to <em>share songs, form groups, and interact with other student musicians</em>.
            We think our app should work intuitively, as we used common design conventions and
            features that are seen in other social apps. 
          </p>
          <p>
            MusicRoom enables users to search based on their interests. For example, a student
            can look for a singer near their location by searching for schools local to them.
            Users can also search based on skills and genre; we want to include musicians of
            diverse backgrounds and experiences. We account for skill sets, genres, and school
            attending as <em>we want musicians to highlight the key details when connecting</em>. The
            app additionally encourages users to share their snippets online when they want to
            share their songs and musical projects. Through a platform that lets users interact
            with other works, it forms interactions and communities between musicians when
            discovering new and trending music made by other students. The app supplements
            musicians in colleges and universities to be creative and innovative by fueling
            inspiration and discovery, <em>what will you create on MusicRoom?</em>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <img src="src/music1.svg" alt="">
        <p>
          Current music-sharing social media platforms suffer from the oversaturation of
          posts. For example, <em>20%</em> of Spotify’s catalog has no streams whatsoever
          (Eriksson 2019). This poses the question — <em>how many songs are there that have the
          potential to be successful but are not due to being overshadowed on the platform?</em>
          Furthermore, current music streaming platforms focus more on broadcasting music
          rather than driving collaboration and building a community of musicians. <em>How can
          we provide more exposure for beginning and young artists?</em> To address both issues,
          we thought that providing a platform for these artists who might have a
          challenging time getting a foothold in the music industry would be helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our idea was also motivated by our firsthand experiences. We are more than just
          students and developers — we have <em>personal hobbies</em> and one of which is
          <em>creating</em> music. However, <em>as people who are not actively pursuing a
          career in music or musical education</em>, we have <em>found it hard to create
          the same network</em> as we have in the fields that we are studying. We have
          found that currently <em>there are few social networking platforms that
          specifically cater to connecting young creatives</em>, and those that do are
          either much <em>too specialized</em> or <em>have a poor interface design</em>
          that is hard to use. Because of this, our focus was to create a platform that
          young musicians would want to use, whose design was easy to use, and
          <em>aesthetically ambiguous</em>, so as not to inadvertently prioritize a
          certain style of musician over another.

            <h3>User Profiles</h3>
            <p>
              The most essential aspect of the app is the profile page, which allows users to
              display their skills, genre, school, about, snippets, and posts. External apps
              such as Spotify, Youtube, and Instagram are also linked to the app; users can go
              to the external apps from there because those apps are very popular and users
              want to share their interests with other musicians. Users will find the snippets
              section particularly useful; they may remove and change the snippets. They can
              also manage and view comments on their posts, as well as remove and edit them.

            <h3>Search Filters</h3>
            <p>
              Users can search for other musicians using search categories such as skills, genre,
              and school since these criteria would fit their demands when looking for other
              musicians.

            <h3>Just For You</h3>
            <p>
              The app's "Just for you" page allows users to browse recommended singers, drummers,
              and popular snippets depending on their search as suggestions are frequently highly
              beneficial when users are unable to find favorites.

              Users can upload their snippets, images, and descriptions in several formats on the
              upload page because users would expect to upload different files.
