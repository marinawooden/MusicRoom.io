          <h2>Hello!</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to <em>MusicRoom</em>!  We're a <em>music-sharing platform</em>
            for <em>college creatives</em> looking to share their music and
            collaborate with other musicians in their area!  We know
            how hard it can be to find other musicians and network.
            We aim to provide a <em>user-friendly interface</em> and platform
            to provoke collaboration- after all, <em>collaboration
            creates innovation.</em>

          <h2>Why did we make this app?</h2>
          <p>
            There are many existing apps such as Spotify, Instagram, and SoundCloud, but
            there are not enough apps that are dedicated to music and connect musicians
            online. The app “Music Room” is for musicians, especially college students.
            The app provides a place for college students to share songs, form groups
            and interact with other college students musicians. The app is very simple
            and straightforward because we think that the app should work intuitively,
            so we used some common design and features that are seen in other social apps.
            The app enables users to search based on their interests, for example, if a
            UW student  looks for a singer near his location, they can just search based on
            school. It totally makes sense because if they want to form a group, location
            matters sometimes. They could search based on skill and genre too; many singers
            have different tastes and skill. The app encourages users to share their
            snippets online because they want to share their songs and if someone likes
            their songs, they could have the opportunity to interact with other musicians;
            users can leave comments on each other. The app helps college students to be
            creative and innovative.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <img src="src/music1.svg" alt="">
        <p>
          Current music-sharing social media platforms suffer from the oversaturation
          of posts.  For example, <em>20%</em> of Spotify’s catalog has no streams whatsoever
          (Eriksson 2019).  This poses the question- <em>how many songs are there that
          could potentially be much more successful, but aren’t because there’s too
          much competition from established artists?</em>  Additionally, current
          music streaming platforms focus more on broadcasting music rather than
          driving collaboration and building a community of musicians.  <em>How can we
          provide more exposure for niche and/or beginning artists?</em>  To address both
          of these issues, we thought that providing a <em>platform</em> for these artists who
          might have a hard time getting a foothold in the music industry would be
          helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our idea was also motivated by our own personal experiences.  We are more
          than just students and developers- we have <em>our own hobbies</em> and one of those
          hobbies is <em>creating music</em>.  However, as <em>people who aren’t actively pursuing
          a career in music</em>, or an education in a field directly related to music,
          we’ve found it hard to create the same network as we have in the fields
          we’re studying.  Additionally, we’ve found that currently there <em>aren’t many</em>
          social networking platforms that specifically cater to connecting young
          creatives, and those that do are either much <em>too specialized</em>, and focus
          on <em>a specific kind of musician</em>, or have a <em>poor interface design</em> and are hard
          to use.  So, our focus was to create a platform that young musicians would
          want to use, whose design was easy to use and <em>aesthetically ambiguous</em>, so as
          not to inadvertently prioritize a certain style of musician over another.

            <h3>User Profiles</h3>
            <p>
              The most essential aspect of the app is the profile page, which allows users to
              display their skills, genre, school, about, snippets, and posts. External apps
              such as Spotify, Youtube and Instagram are also linked to the app; users can go
              to the external apps from there because those apps are very popular and users
              want to share their interests with other musicians. Users will find the snippets
              section particularly useful; they may remove and change the snippets. They can
              also manage and view comments on their posts, as well as remove and edit them.

            <h3>Search Filters</h3>
            <p>
              Users can search for other musicians using search categories such as skills, genre,
              and school since these criteria would fit their demands while looking for other
              musicians.

            <h3>Just For You</h3>
            <p>
              the app's "Just for you" page allows users to browse recommended singers, drummers,
              and popular snippets depending on their search as suggestions are frequently highly
              beneficial when users are unable to find favorites.

              Users can upload their snippets, images, and descriptions in several formats on the
              post page because users would expect to upload different files.
